Bug report on frontier forum [link](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/475203-Connection-error)  

Started logging connection errors, each log is from starting the launcher in windows, until error occured, then game is closed and launcher is closed.

I updated my NVIDIA driver between 1 and 2.
