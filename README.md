Bug report on frontier forum [link](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/475203-Connection-error)  

Started logging connection errors, each log is from starting the launcher in windows, until error occured, then game is closed and launcher is closed.

I updated my grafics driver between 1 and 2.

2. [connection error, change ship](https://github.com/bent-mortensen/ED/tree/master/change%20ship/30-01-2019)
